TOP Recipes Project

This is a project that will demonstrate some basic HTML fundamentals I've learned which include the following:

1. Creating a boiler plate html document from scratch.
2. Using html elements like <p> (paragraph), <strong>, <em> (emphasize), and <h1> - <h6> (headers) to display various text types on the webpage.
3. Using the <a>(anchor) element along with its href(hyperlink reference) property to display links on the webpage.
4. Using the <img>(image) element along with its src and alt properties to display images on the webpage.
5. Make great commits.
