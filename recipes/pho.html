    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pho is a soup consisting of bone broth, rice noodles, thinly-sliced meat
      (in this recipe, it's beef), and fresh garnishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with many foods, the origins of pho are unknown. It is believed to have
      been created in northern Vietnam in the early 20th century. It gained
      popularity in many countries after the Vietnam War.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Place beef bones on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven until
        browned, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place onion halves on a second baking sheet and roast on another rack
        until blackened and soft, about 45 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer beef bones and onion halves to a large stockpot. Add ginger,
        salt, star anise, fish sauce, and 4 quarts water; bring to a boil.
        Reduce heat to low and simmer for 6 to 10 hours. Strain the broth into a
        saucepan and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place rice noodles in a large bowl filled with room temperature water.
        Let soak for 1 hour. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        When noodles have soaked for 1 hour, heat up the reserved broth by
        bringing it to a simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the noodles in the boiling
        water for 1 minute. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide noodles among 4 serving bowls; top with sirloin, cilantro, and
        green onion. Ladle hot broth over the top. Stir and let sit until beef
        is partially cooked and no longer pink, 1 to 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve with bean sprouts, Thai basil, lime wedges, hoisin sauce, and
        chile-garlic sauce on the side.
      </li>
    </ol>
